# X-Y-Z-Motion-Platform
It's just created for research the stepper motor motion control since my fellow is researching and making the experiments about it.

You can burn this program to your 51SCM like AT89C52 or STC89S52, thenyou need to build an X-Y Motion Platform(including the stepper motors,
 control circuit and display circuit). After finishing above work, design or take a ready-made picture and demarcate the coordinate in the
picture. In the end, you should use the fuction line(float x,float y,char n) and cicle(float x0,float y0,float x,float y,char n,char r) to
list the relative coordinates in sequence. Then start your machine to realize your image.
Otherwise, you can modify this program and use Arduino uno or other boards to have a try.
